                    saltwater crocodiles and flatback turtles to birds. Aboriginal rock paintings, dating to prehistoric times, can be 
                    viewed at sites such as Nourlangie, Nanguluwur and Ubirr.</p>

            <p class = "RuleHeader">Stay Safe In Kakadu</p>
            <p>We want you to have a fantastic holiday that’s memorable for all the right reasons. Kakadu is a wild place – here are our tips to help you stay safe!

                Take lots of water with you and drink at least four litres a day.<br>
                Protect yourself from the sun with a broad-brimmed hat, long loose clothing and a high factor sunscreen.<br>
                Wear sturdy shoes.<br>
                During your visit, please always follow directions from park rangers - their directions are for your safety.<br>
                Stay on marked tracks and in designated visitor areas - you don’t want to meet the local crocodiles up close!<br>
                Bringing a boat? Saltwater crocodiles can attack people in boats - the smaller the boat the greater the risk.<br>
                Be aware of your own limitations and supervise children.<br>
                You won’t have mobile phone coverage in most of the park. Tell a responsible person where you are heading for the day and when you plan to return.<br>
                Some roads in and out of the national park are 4WD only and many sections are steep and narrow and become slippery when wet. Drive carefully and slowly.<br>
                Obey all safety directions, notices and warning signs.<br>
            </p>
            <p class = "RuleHeader">Covid 19</p>
            <p>We need to all keep making COVIDSafe choices to help stop the spread. Here are things you can do to be COVIDSafe when visiting Kakadu National Park.<br>

                Practice social distancing -this means keeping a distance of at least 1.5 metres from other people and not shaking hands.<br>
                Coughing and/or sneezing into your bent elbow or a tissue, rather than hands, and disposing of the tissue immediately.<br>
                Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitiser for 20 to 30 seconds.<br>
                Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.<br>
                Protect others and stay at home if you’re unwell.<br>
                If you’re experiencing cold or flu-like symptoms get tested for COVID-19.<br>
            </p>
            <p class = "RuleHeader">Water Safety</p>
            <p>Kakadu’s waterways and natural pools are spectacular however they can also be treacherous for swimmers. Some of the waterways are susceptible to flash flooding and rapid currents, and 
                many of the waterways are home to crocodiles. Crocodiles usually hunt by staying submerged and can attack in knee-deep water, so even wading can be dangerous.<br>

                Visitors to Kakadu are urged to heed the following warnings in order to enjoy a safe and worry-free visit to this picturesque wonderland.<br>
                
                It can be dangerous to swim in Kakadu’s waterways and natural pools.<br>
                Observe all safety warning signs in the park.<br>
                Always be aware of your surroundings.<br>
                Maintain a safe distance from the waters’ edge.<br>
                Be alert to changes in the weather as flash flooding can occur causing dangerously rapid currents.<br>
                Be careful when walking around the waterfalls and rock pools as these areas can be very slippery.<br>
                Be aware that submerged rocks and parts of trees may pose a severe risk.<br>
                Be aware that water in rock pools can be extremely cold and can induce shock, especially on hot days.<br>
                Carry a first aid kit with you and always take an adequate supply of water on walks.<br>
                Take note of the location of emergency call devices in case someone needs help.<br>
                The safest place to swim in Kakadu is in a public or hotel pool, and you should never swim alone.<br>
                
            </p>
            <p class = "RuleHeader">Beat The Heat</p>
            <p>Temperatures in the park regularly reach 30°C or more and can exceed 40°C during summer.<br>

                Heat exhaustion, dehydration and hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood) are very real dangers here.<br>
                
                To avoid heat-related issues while walking in the park:<br>
                
                Walk only in the cooler parts of the day, avoiding the hottest period between 2.30 pm and 6.30 pm. In summer we strongly recommend not walking after 11.00 am.<br>
                Wear a broad-brimmed hat, sunscreen and sturdy walking shoes.<br>
                Carry and drink at least one litre of water per person per hour.<br>
                Don’t consume sports drinks, diet cordials or caffeinated drinks – these can all contribute to dehydration.<br>
                Consider using an electrolyte product (such as Hydralyte or Gastrolyte) to replace lost fluids.<br>
                Familiarise yourself with the symptoms of heatstroke and heat-related illness (see below).<br>
                Eat regular meals, take frequent breaks and eat plenty of healthy snacks, even if you don’t feel hungry.<br>
                Walk with another person at all times.<br>
                Obey all safety directions, notices and warning signs, including any directions from park rangers.<br>
                Stay on marked tracks at all times.<br>
                Do not walk on any tracks that are closed due to the heat.<br>
                If you have any concerns about your health or fitness, avoid physical activity (including walking) in extreme heat.<br>
                </p>
            <p class = "RuleHeader">Drive Safely</p>
            <p>Crossing flooded creeks and rivers can be extremely hazardous so obey directions from rangers and heed road closures at all times.<br>

                Many visitors to Kakadu may not be familiar with driving on dirt roads. Stay safe on our dirt roads, please drive to your ability and obey speed limits. Remember: <br>
                
                Plan ahead and obtain a detailed map before you set off.<br>
                Drive slowly and cautiously – 80 km/h is too fast in most conditions.<br>
                Avoid soft shoulders in the road.<br>
                Allow plenty of space behind the vehicle in front.<br>
                Slow down for on-coming traffic.<br>
                Keep headlights on during the day to increase visibility.<br>
                Lower tyre pressure when driving on rougher roads (check your car rental conditions).<br>
                Watch out for wildlife, pedestrians and other road users.<br>
                </p>
            <p class = "RuleHeader">Injured Wildlife</p>
            <p>If you see an injured animal in the park - please notify staff in the Bowali Visitor Centre either in person or by phone on 08 8938 1120.</p>
